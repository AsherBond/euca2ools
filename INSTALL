Pre-requisites
--------------

Euca2ools depends on the boto REST library. You must have boto-1.8a installed prior to installing Euca2ools. In addition,
Euca2ools requires the M2Crypto python library version 0.19.1 or higher. python2.5 (dev) or higher is also required.
For convenience, boto-1.8a and M2Crypto-0.19.1 are provided in the deps directory.

Installation
------------
1. Install boto-1.8a 

To do this, untar boto-1.8a.tar.gz and run "sudo setup.py install"

2. Install M2Crypto-0.19.1

To do this, untar M2Crypto-0.19.1-tar.gz and run "sudo setup.py install"

Note that M2Crypto needs swig and libssl-dev (or equivalent) in order to install.

3. Install Euca2ools.

"sudo make" in the top-level directory.

Running
-------

Make sure that the following environment variables are set:

EC2_URL, EC2_ACCESS_KEY, EC2_PRIVATE_KEY, EC2_CERT, EC2_PRIVATE_KEY, S3_URL, EUCALYPTUS_CERT (optional)

If you are running Euca2ools against Eucalyptus, sourcing the "eucarc" file that is included as part of the credentials that you downloaded from the Eucalyptus web interface should be enough to setup the above variables correctly.

Try it!

For example:

./euca-describe-availability-zones verbose
AVAILABILITYZONE	mycluster	  UP mycluster.mydomain
AVAILABILITYZONE	|- vm types	free / max   cpu   ram  disk
AVAILABILITYZONE	|- m1.xlarge	0007 / 0008   1    512     3
AVAILABILITYZONE	|- m1.small	0007 / 0008   1    512     3
